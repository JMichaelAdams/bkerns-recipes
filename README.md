Download, Munki, and Pkg recipes for EMC Syncplicity client. Munki and Pkg recipes include a preinstall script that removes an existing verions, and a postinstall script that copies first-run files into place to prevent admin prompting and disables software update check and notifications.

####EMCSyncplicitySSO

Same in all functionality as the standard Synplicity client recipes, but downloads the SSO client instead (slightly different).

A pkg recipe for StuffIt expander that references keelysam's download recipe.

####TechSmithCamtasia

####TechSmithSnagit

*NOTE: I previously used Munki regularly, but have recently moved to a JAMF shop. I have provided Munki recipes that I believe should work, but I do not make use of them. Munki Admins, please let me know if a Munki recipe needs adjusted!*
